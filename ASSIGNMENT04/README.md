# Assignment 04: Personas & Scenarios
## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is an important communication tool that helps designers keep in mind _who_ they are designing for when creating a product, rather than making assumptions about what will bring value to users. Storytelling is an effective way of helping us empathize with users by allowing us to understand their context and emotionally connect with them. It is vital to understand the user's motivations, thoughts, and pain points in order to create an experience that will help them achieve their goals.

## Design Features
Based on the user research, I am planning to implement 2 design features in the site:
1. "Get involved" page: Provides a list of either organizations or events that allows the user to filter by location, cause area, as well as time commitment for the events.
2. Resources page - A page that provides educational information about which areas of ocean conservation the user could get involved in, SDG goals, and options for courses of action.
