# Assignment 04: Personas & Scenarios
## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is an important communication tool that helps designers keep in mind _who_ they are designing for when creating a product, rather than making assumptions about what will bring value to users. Storytelling is an effective way of helping us empathize with users by allowing us to understand their context and emotionally connect with them. It is vital to understand the user's motivations, thoughts, and pain points in order to create an experience that will help them achieve their goals.

## Design Features
Based on the user research, I am planning to implement 2 design features in the site:
1. "Take action" page: Provides a list of either organizations or events that allows the user to filter by location, cause area, as well as time commitment for the events.
2. Resources page: A page that provides educational information including the SDG goals, information about sub-issues that fall under ocean conservation, and courses of action

## User Scenarios and Journey Maps

### Alice's Scenario
**Why**

Alice was born into the Generation Z, who has been constantly exposed to media that tells them that in the future, their world will be greatly impacted by the effects of environmental degredation. She has always been quite aware of the issue and makes individual choices and efforts to help, such as not using plastic straws, reducing her plastic use, recycling, etc. One day, she decides to go on Instagram and sees a startling video depicting tons of plastic waste piling up on a beach and animals trapped in plastic. She decides that singular choices and actions are not enough for her and that she wants to get involved through direct action. She goes to her computer and looks up ways to help ocean conservation online, however she becomes frustrated because she is only able to find general information about ways to help, and most of it is through individual choises--which she is already doing. Another frustration is that she keeps being shown large-scale organizations that do not seem accessible and she still does not know how she can directly help.

**How**

Alice finds a website for ocean conservation that provides her with informational resources and a database of organizations to get involved with. At the home page, she sees the "Take Action" page and clicks on it. She sees that she can choose between a list of events or organizations, and since she is mostly interested in the kind of work she can get involved in, she opts to look at the events first. She sees that she can filter the results, so she sets the location to "Los Angeles" since that is where she currently resides, and she sets the time commitment to "Low", as she is a busy college student. She scrolls through the events and sees that there is a beach cleanup happening in Santa Monica next weekend. She clicks on the event to learn more about it and clicks on the name of the organization, which navigates her to information about it. She connects with the description of the organization and thinks that she would like to try it out, she also thinks the event would be a good match for her based on the description, location and date. She registers for the event and is now excited and hopeful for the start of her journey with ocean conservation.

### Kevin' Scenario
**Why** 

Kevin is currently living in San Francisco, and after years of different jobs as a software engineer, he feels like he has finally settled into his career and is making more money than he ever has. However, he feels like something is missing and often thinks back to his involvement in environmental clubs in high school and college--he something he lost touch with during his early career years. He knows that he is currently far too busy to do any hands-on volunteer work, but he wants to put his extra money towards a good cause. He searches online for ocean conservation organizations to donate to, but is overwhelmed with the sheer amount of results, he goes through so many organization's websites, but there is so much information that he can't remember who does what. He wants to find out information about what kinds of areas of the issue need help are often overlooked, but he doesn't even know where to start. Google only shows him large-scale, popular organizations and he becomes frustrated because he doesn't want to donate to just _any_ organization, but one that he feels truly needs his help that he connects with.

**How**

Kevin finds a website for ocean conservation that provides her with informational resources and a database of organizations that he can help. The first thing he does is click on the "Resources" page in the Navigation bar, where is provided with information about ocean conservation, including the SDG goals, ways to help, and information about sub-issues that fall under ocean conservation. He spends some time on this page taking trying to educate himself further on ocean conservation and to find a particular area of interest that he wants to get involved with. He sees that one of the sub-isses is "overfishing", which catches his interest, as he has not heard a lot of information about this topic. He reads through an article on the website that describes the issue, its impacts, and how people are trying to solve it. He decides then that he wants to find an organization that helps combat overfishing. He then navigates to the "Take action" page and sees that he can choose between organizations and events. Since he does not want to volunteer at the moment, he clicks on organizations. He is able to see information including their mission, what they have acommplished, and their CharityNavigator score. Because he is looking for something specific, he filters by "cause area", and chooses "overfishing". He looks through the results and finds an organizatio whose goal is to stop overfishing. He reads their biography and feels instantly connected with their mission. He also sees that they have an excellent Charity Navigator score, so he knows they are trustworthy. He clicks on their website link and makes his first donation! He feels extremely satisfied and knows that he will want to use the website to find more organizations to donate to in the future.
