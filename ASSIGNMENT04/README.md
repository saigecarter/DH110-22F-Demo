# Assignment 04: Personas & Scenarios
## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is an important communication tool that helps designers keep in mind _who_ they are designing for when creating a product, rather than making assumptions about what will bring value to users. Storytelling is an effective way of helping us empathize with users by allowing us to understand their context and emotionally connect with them. It is vital to understand the user's motivations, thoughts, and pain points in order to create an experience that will help them achieve their goals.

## Design Features
Based on the user research, I am planning to implement 2 design features in the site:
1. Filters - filter based on location, time commitment, etc. 
2. Descriptions about teh shit. CharityChecker score or whateve. Or a page specifically for events
