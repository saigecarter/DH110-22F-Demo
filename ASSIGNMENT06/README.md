## Description of Project

My project aims to empower people who are interested in ocean conservation through informational resources as well as helping them take the next step to get involved through volunteering or connecting with an organization they may want to support. The target user for research is students or working professionals between the ages of 20-30 located within the United States (specifically coastal areas). The user research focuses on understanding what a user needs to feel equipped to start taking action, what information those interested in volunteer value when looking for an organiztion, and what encourages people to take action on an issue. 

### Purpose of Interface Design

The purpose of creating this interface design is to ensure that users can navigate the website and access components with ease, as well as to ensure that the site is accessible to those from all walks of life. Creating the design system allows the designer to re-use elements and ensures that the interface remains consistent throughout the website.

## Screen Interface Designs 

### Typographic Variations

For my website, I wanted to use a sans-serif font to increase readability, since my website would contain a lot of content, with the exception that Heading 1 may be a Serif font for a more eye-catching effect. I tested three different typography variations: Articulat CF, Montserrat, and Georgia + Sofia Pro.

Ultimately, I landed on using Articulat CF because I wanted the website to have a more modern feel, as the target users would be Gen Z and Millenials. I also felt that the font was a great choice due its incredible readability.

### Shape Variations

I decided that I wanted rounded corners throughout my design, but had to choose between three different intensity levels of roundedness. I decided on using the *medium rounded* option. I wanted to keep the friendly, approachable and modern feel that rounded corners offered. However, I felt that having *too round* corners would cause the website too look less professional.

### Color Palettes

For the different color palletes, I created a light and dark mode for my design. I first decided on various shades of blue for my color pallete because my theme has to do with ocean conservation. However, I also chose blue because it generally evokes a feeling trustworthiness and reliability, which is very important for my site, as it provides users with informational resources as well as volunteer opportunities and organizations. As users are investing time and possibily money into these things, it is crucial they feel confident they are getting their information from a secure source. Lastly, I also chose blue because it provides a feeling of calmness--since the site is information heavy, I wanted to offset any feeling of being overwhelmed as much as possible.

### Layout

For the website layout, I used 12 columns with 100px margins to contain the content and 60px gutters. I used 6 rows with 180px margins and 80px gutters. Lastly, I also used an 8px grid in order to space out the smaller elements by multiples of 8. I chose this design mainly because I was aware this was common pracice and had used a 12 column 8pt system in the past before. I chose the 6 columns because this was the best way to fit the event cards,
