# Assignment 3

## Introduction

### Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
My project aims to provide an accesible digital experience that empowers users who are looking to get involved in ocean conservation efforts through informational resources as well as ways to find organizations that align with their goals and interests. I hope to solve the issue of a lack of centralized information on local organizations the user can get involved with.

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

The basic [need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#:~:text=needs.%5B21%5D-,Esteem%20needs,-%5Bedit%5D) involved in this activity would be self-esteem. Many people, especially within the younger age demographic feel like the society they are apart of has a disregard for the environment. Most people know that when they buy or throw away plastic, they are contributing to ocean pollution. Often feeling like there is no escape to contributing to pollution of the ocean we feel a lot of guilt surrounding this. Being able to combat ocean pollution through action is something that would greatly contribute to one's esteem. Knowing that one is making a positive difference in the world/doing their part would greatly contribute to the "higher" esteem needs, having to do with self respect. This activity could also support to the "lower" esteem needs, in gaining respect from others, from their regular peers and possibly extending to others in the ocean conservation community. 

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
There are general websites about the Life Below Water goal, such as https://www.globalgoals.org/goals/14-life-below-water/, https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/, providing basic information about the SDG goal. Another typical solution is simply to search for ocean conservation volunteering near me, and look around on the various organizations websites until they find one they might be intersted in. There are few websites with that serve as a centralized hub for both informational resources as well as a database of organizations that one could contribute to, such as https://fundingtheocean.org.

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
The general websites about the Life Below Water goal only provide information about the SDG goal, but do not provide any information about how they can help besides a general list of ways they can help. Users are not provided with organizations they can actually help with. At this point, they might not be motivated to take the next steps for their conservation journey. Once they reach the point of looking for organizations and ways they can make an impact, they have to look through the organizations various opportunities/programs to see if it would work for them, which can be frustrating as they put in time to look for orgs only to find that it doesnt fit for them. The website https://fundingtheocean.org/ is also geared more towards experts and is not very accessible to someone who might be a beginner in their ocean conservation journey. The solution would be a centralized hub where the user can have access to informative resources, find out what kind of contribution they would like to make, and find local/accessible organizations best align with their situation. 

### Target Users 

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)

Students or working professionals between the ages of 20-30. For the scope of this project, the users should be located within the United States. The user expertise should be able to range from basic to expert, but generally geared towards those with access to internet and a basic ability to search on the internet.

#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?

Where: This activity could be done anywhere the user has access to the internet, but most likely in their own home. This is likely not a priority, so whenever they have free time.
Why: Likely if the user has been recently thinking a lot about ocean pollution and feeling interested in or frustrated with this issue. This could be the result of recent news about startling ocean pollution statistics or a recent crisis that they have heard about, or alternative sources such as social media.
Under which conditions: The user is interested enough in the issue and they know they have the time/money to contribute to the cause. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?

The user would typically utilize a search engine to find information about how they can get involved in ocean conservation.

### Observation Methods 

**Active Participant Observation**: During the interview, I interacted with the participant by asking them questions and recorded their answers. I learned more about the participant's background information. 

**Overt-passive Participant Observation**: During the activities, the participant was aware of my presence, and I was also the one to tell them what activities to perform. However, I was observing the participant's behaviors and was not actively participating in the activities.

### Interesting insights from the interview 

**1. Information on a social issue itself is not efficient to help one feel equipped to take action**

> (24:12) I feel like I am not necessarily equipped to deal with any of these on an individual level. Maybe like if I found an organization that like dealt with any of this stuff like that would be possible. But most of these targets are like very governmental level initiatives. Like it's about legislation and regulation and stuff, which like a normal person can't do anything about that.

> (25:02) I would say it's accessible if your goal is to get information, but I think if someone's goal was to take action and to become involved in ocean sustainability, and that sort of, cause I don't really think this would be that helpful, because there are no specific individual actions or any like resources for people.

**2. Those who are interested/experienced in volunteer work care a lot about the "economics" of an organization**

> (35:33)  I like the website Charity Navigator, it gives like ratings for different charities and like nonprofits that rate some on all sorts of stuff, but like how well they spend their money like the impact they have.

> (44:36) \[An ideal tool would have]  their reputation, their economics... (15:33) Like their financial impact, like how they spend their donations and like how much I think like your common measures like how much value they get out of every dollar donation they earn, like how much goes towards their, like, advertising costs, because a lot of charities like, have fun fundraisers that to get more money that they have to spend money on or like, how much they pay their executives and stuff.

**3. Time commitment is an important metric used to determine what event one would participate in**

> (44:49) I also think that's really cool that they have the time commitment kind of labeled. I don't see that that often. 

> (37:00) The time commitment thing is really nice. That's like a very good metric that they have, but also just like seeing when and like, how much of time commitment it is, and where it is, like if it's somewhere I could get to easily. Yeah.

> (44:36) You could get involved based off of time commitment, I thought that like, color coding was really cool and like that could be applied into that.

**4. Understanding how it can effect them is important in encouraging people to take action on an issue**

> (46:35) I think getting people to be passionate about it and like, understand the implications, because I do think like ocean conservation, it's easy to be like, I'm not affected by that. Like you can still get your sushi and like, you can still have all that stuff, but like to have people understand that like, within their lifetime, they're going to be directly affected, like people care about stuff that impacts them. Like we're all kind of selfish. So I think like, appealing to that nature and people. 

### Reflection 
I learned alot in my experience of planning and conducting an interview. Before this activity, I was curious as to why learning so much about a particular user rather than how they interact with a product was necessary, but after completion, it was clear how much the participant's background and context related with their behaviors and answers during the activity. For example, I chose my participant based on the fact that she had been involved with a lot of volunteer work in the past, and I learned that she had discovered through experience what *kind* of information about organizations is important to her when choosing the right one. This gave me very valuable insight into what things people who are more likely to volunteer actually value. My participant also shared my concern over there being a lack of a centralized source that people could find accessible organizations to volunteer for, so I was relieved that that was validated. I also learned a lot about how I should prepare the interview and activity guide beforehand. One particular thing is that without realizing, I somewhat predicted or presumed how the participant might respond. For example, for the activity that asked them to "find out how you want to contribute to a cause", I think I was expecting them to look up different types of ways to contribute. However, they ended up searching for local volunteer opportunities, causing me to slightly panic, because I expected them to do that for the third activity! This taught me to make sure that in the future I am preparing materials without any preconvieved expectations in mind. I also prepared a lot of questions to ask during the activities, but in the future I think I would make it less structured and more open ended so that I have time to ask questions based on previous answers that I was curious about and gain information I had not considered. Lastly, in terms of technical difficulties, I did not realize that there was a limit for time on the trancription app that I was using, so I had to pause the the video and restart the audio recording, which somewhat interrupted the flow of the conversation. In the future I would just make sure to check for any issues with the tech beforehand.
