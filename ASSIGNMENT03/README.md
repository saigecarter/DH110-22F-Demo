## Contextual Inquiry 

BLurb about contextual inquiry or something 

### Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
My project aims to provide an accesible digital experience that empowers users who are looking to get involved in ocean conservation efforts through informational resources as well as ways to find organizations that align with their goals and interests.

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

The basic [need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#:~:text=needs.%5B21%5D-,Esteem%20needs,-%5Bedit%5D) involved in this activity would be self-esteem. Many people, especially within the yuonger age demographic feel like the society they are apart of has a disregard for the environment. Most people know that when they buy or throw away plastic, they are contributing to ocean pollution. Often feeling like there is no escape to contributing to pollution of the ocean we feel a lot of guilt surrounding this. Being able to combat ocean pollution through action is something that would greatly contribute to one's esteem. Knowing that one is making a positive difference in the world/doing their part would greatly contribute to the "higher" esteem needs, having to do with self respect. Could also go to the "lower" respect, in gaining respect from others, from their regular peers and possibly extending to others in the ocean conservation community. 

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
There are general websites about the Life Below Water goal, such as https://www.globalgoals.org/goals/14-life-below-water/, https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/, providing basic information about the SDG goal. Another typical solution is simply to search for ocean conservation volunteering near me, and look around on the various organizations websites until they find one they might be intersted in. There are few websites with that serve as a centralized hub for both informational resources as well as a database of organizations that one could contribute to.

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
The general websites about the Life Below Water goal only provide information about the SDG goal, but do not provide any information about how they can help besides a general list of ways they can help. But they are not provided with organizations they can actual help with. At this point, they might not take the next steps for their conservation journey. Once they reach the point of looking for organizations and ways they can make an impact, they have to look through the organizations various opportunities/programs to see if it would work for them, which can be frustrating as they put in time to look for orgs only to find that it doesnt fit for them. The solution would be a centralized hub where the user can find out what kind of contribution they would like to make -- systems change, field volunteer work, or donating, and which organizations best align with their situation. 

### Target Users 

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)

Students or working professionals between the ages of 20-30. For the scope of this project, the users should be located within the United States. The user expertise should be able to range from basic to expert, but generally geared towards those with access to internet and a basic ability to search on the internet.

#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?

Where: could be done anywhere the user has access to the internet, but most likely in their own home. Probably not priority, so whenever they have free time.
Why: Likely if the user has been recently thinking a lot about ocean pollution and feeling guilty or frustrated with this issue. This could be the result of recent news about startling ocean pollution statistics or a recent crisis that they have heard about, or social media, etc. 
Under which conditions: They know they have the time/money to contribute to the cause and are willing to. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?

Utilize a search engine to find information about how they can get involved in ocean conservation.
