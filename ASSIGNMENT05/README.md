## Project Description 

### User research:

My project aims to empower people who are interested in ocean conservation through informational resources as well as helping them take the next step to get involved through volunteering or connecting with an organization they may want to support. The target user for research is students or working professionals between the ages of 20-30 located within the United States (specifically coastal areas). The user research focuses on understanding what a user needs to feel equipped to start taking action, what information those interested in volunteer value when looking for an organiztion, and what encourages people to take action on an issue. 

### User personas

Based on the user research, I created 2 personas that could represent two types of users:

> **Persona 1:** Alice Smith is a 19 year old college student majoring in psychology. As a Generation Z kid, she has constantly been exposed to media about how the environment is being negatively affected by human activities. She has always made an effort to make individual choices that help, such as reducing plastic use, but the more she sees about ocean pollution, the more she desires to take action. She wants to find volunteering opportunities to help fight ocean pollution through organized action. 

> **Persona 2:** Kevin Sato is a 26 year old software engineer based in San Francisco. Kevin misses his old days of being in environmentalist clubs in high school and college and still has passion for the issue. However, he has just settled into his career and is too busy to commit to hands-on volunteer work. However, he desires to find the right organizations that align with his interests and values that he can make donations to. 

## Features

1. **Volunteer opportunities** - provides a list of volunteer opportunities based on various details including location and cause area, and allows user to register for events.
2. **Organizations** - provides a list of organizations based on details including location and cause area, and allows user to view more information about the organization. 
3. **Resources page** - page that provides the user with information including pressing ocean issues, the SDG targets, and ways to help. 

> Note: Previously, there were two features, but I found while designing that it was better to split the "Get involved" feature into the seperate "Volunteer opportunities" and "Organizations" features, as they more distinct than expected

## Purpose

Low-fidelity prototypes allow the designer to focus on the functionality of the site,  make early changes/improvements, and come up with alternative solutions based on testing the prototype with a user. This can all be done before the designer commits too much, so that more specific details about the design can be focused on later, after all of the most important functionality issues have been resolved.

## Reflection 

I found creating the wireframes to be enjoyable once there was a general layout determined, because everything seemed to come together quicker as I went along, and I was able to build off what I previously had. The most difficult part was trying to visualize everything and how the user would interact with a page before anything was on the page. What I found helpful was looking at other websites for inspiration--for example, looking at other websites with a search bar for an events helped me figure out the search bar. 

As for testing, it mostly went smoothly, although the participant was confused by the testing at first, they were able to understand it and do it once I showed them other student examples. For the most part, the process went smoothly, and my participant was mostly able to recreate the wireflow as intended. One problem that I realized as it was being tested was that there were not enough "transition" frames in the flow to fully show the interactions. For example, in the "Find an organzation" wireflow, there should have been another frame after the wireframe showing the location being selected that showed the location locked into the search bar. _Then_ on that frame, they would be able to draw the arrow from the search button to the next page. However, although it was not technically how the wireflow should look, the participant understood which action would have to come first and drew an arrow from the location menu button to the search button. 

Based on the testing, there are a few things that I found that I would change about my design:
- The participant was not sure if you would be able to change the location once you typed one in. This shows that the "X" I put there was not visible enough, therefore in my next design I would make the X either larger or closer to the text, and possibly add a color. 
- The participant also noted that they would have liked to have a confirmation page with more details about the event after registering for an event. Previously, I had a page that said "Thank you for registering! We will send a confirmation to your email with further details". Clearly,, this is not the way that websites would usually provide the user with a confirmation if that is not what she was expecting, so I should change this to having a page with confirmation details, likely with an additional message that it will also be sent to their email.
