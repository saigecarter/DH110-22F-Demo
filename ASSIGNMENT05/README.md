## Reflection 

I found creating the wireframes to be enjoyable once there was a general layout determined, because everything seemed to come together quicker as I went along, and I was able to build off what I previously had. The most difficult part was trying to visualize everything and how the user would interact with a page before anything was on the page. What I found helpful was looking at other websites for inspiration--for example, looking at other websites with a search bar for an events helped me figure out the search bar. 

As for testing, it mostly went smoothly, although the participant was confused by the testing at first, they were able to understand it and do it once I showed them other student examples. For the most part, the process went smoothly, and my participant was mostly able to recreate the wireflow as intended. One problem that I realized as it was being tested was that there were not enough "transition" frames in the flow to fully show the interactions. For example, in the "Find an organzation" wireflow, there should have been another frame after the wireframe showing the location being selected that showed the location locked into the search bar. _Then_ on that frame, they would be able to draw the arrow from the search button to the next page. However, although it was not technically how the wireflow should look, the participant understood which action would have to come first and drew an arrow from the location menu button to the search button. 

Based on the testing, there are a few things that I found that I would change about my design:
- The participant was not sure if you would be able to change the location once you typed one in. This shows that the "X" I put there was not visible enough, therefore in my next design I would make the X either larger or closer to the text, and possibly add a color. 
- The participant also noted that they would have liked to have a confirmation page with more details about the event after registering for an event. Previously, I had a page that said "Thank you for registering! We will send a confirmation to your email with further details". Clearly,, this is not the way that websites would usually provide the user with a confirmation if that is not what she was expecting, so I should change this to having a page with confirmation details, likely with an additional message that it will also be sent to their email.
