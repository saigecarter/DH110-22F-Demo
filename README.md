# Project: Tides of Change

Saige Carter | DH110 | Fall 2022

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to help people get involved in ocean conservation by connecting them to volunteer opportunities and organizations. The foundation for the project was based on choosing one of the topics of the UN's sustainable development goals that interested me. I chose the UN Global Goal #14: Life Below Water. 
I chose this topic because, like many, I am very aware of the endangerment of the ocean caused by problems such as plastic pollution, climate change, and overfishing. However, many people can relate in sharing the concern for our ocean, but feel distanced from the problem or disconnected from the ability to help. Therefore, I wanted to focus my project on empowering people to get involved in ocean conservation. 

## Design Statement

While looking for websites related to the Life Below Water UN Goal, I found that there was a lack websites/platforms that served as a centralized source for people to get involved. Some would only list individual ways to help such as "reducing waste", "buying local fish", or general statements such as "support a Goal 14 charity" or "organize a cleanup project", but the users were left to find a way to achieve their goals without any resources being provided. After noticing this gap, my question was:  **How might I design an accessible digital platform that empowers users looking to make an impact in ocean conservation efforts by connecting them to volunteer opportunities and organizations that align with their interests?**

## Competitor Analysis

### Heurstic Evaluation

The first step was to conduct a heuristic evaluation of the websites [Funding the Ocean](https://fundingtheocean.org/) and [Marine Watch International](https://marinewatchintl.force.com/main/s/?language=en_US) based on the heuristics by [Jakob Neilson](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) to analyze the user interface of its design. If the website was found to violate one of the heuristics, they were given a severity rating. For this task, I looked for websites that attempted to provide the users with resources and connect them to events and organizations related to ocean conservation, so I was interested in seeing how the heuristics related to this kind of website. Below are the overall assesments from the evaluations:

**Funding the Ocean:**
> Funding the Ocean website has an abundance of information, which can be hard to organize but overall the navigation and organization of content was user friendly. However the site has issues in match to the real world, consistency and standards, user control and freedom, recognition rather than recall, and aesthetic and minimalist design. Many of these issues have to do with the Funding Map feature, as it is a unique feature that would require more work into making more intuitive. Visually, I think the website would benefit from greater contrast between the banners and Title text, and the colors of the headers to improve the visual heirarchy.

### Usability Testing

Following my heuristic analysis, I conducted a usability testing on the [Funding the Ocean](https://fundingtheocean.org/) to evaluate the usability of the website and test how the user's ability to reach their goals might be affected by the problems found in the heuristic analysis. I asked the volunteer in the test to complete three tasks that the website offers: 1. Find information about a local organization in Los Angeles 2. Find which resources the website is provides 3. Find events to learn about ocean conservation efforts you can attend virtually. 
I found that during the test, the user was mostly able to complete the tasks they were given, but ran into some difficulty. Unexpectedly, the usability testing also exposed usability problems with the site that I missed during the heuristic analysis.

## User Research

After identifying the design problems of competitor sites through the heuristic analysis and usability testing, it was important to gain an understanding of the potential users for my site. To achieve this, I conducted a contextual inquiry with someone as close as possible to my target user. I decided to interview someone who was deeply involved with volunteer work to better understand what methods they use to find volunteer opportunities and organizations to get involved with and what kind of information they value in this process. This information was key to keep in mind how I would create a design solution for my target users. Some of the key takeaways included:

1. Information on a social issue itself is not sufficient to help one feel equipped to take action 
2. Those who are interested/experienced in volunteer work care a lot about the "economics" of an organization
3. Time commitment is an important metric used to determine what event one would participate in, so displaying it is helpful 
4. Understanding how it can effect them is important in encouraging people to take action on an issue. 

The full contextual inquiry can be found at [Assignment 3](https://github.com/saigecarter/DH110-22F-SC/tree/main/ASSIGNMENT03).

## UX Storytelling


### User Personas

After conducting research to better understand my target users, I developed two personas and user journey maps to help me empathize with users and keep in mind _who_ I would be designing the platform for. Based on the previous research conducted, I created personas that would demonstrate the motivations, thoughts, goals, and pain points that a two types of potenital users of my product would have. 

#### User Personas and Empathy Maps 

Persona 1: Alice Smith is a Generation Z college student in Los Angeles, who has been exposed media about the endangerment of the oceans throughout her life and has a deep concern for the issue. She wants to take the next step further than individual actions and get involved with a volunteer organization in her community. 

Persona 2: Kevin Sato is a 26 year olf software engineer based in San Francisco, who was involved in environmentalism throughut his youth, but feels like he has been missing that part of his life in recent years focusing on his career. He is too busy to commit to hands-on volunteer work, but wants to find an organization whose mission he connects with to make donations to.

## Wireframes & User Interface Design

With the developed personas created to guide my design process, I decided to develop three features that the user would have:

1. Volunteer opportunities - provides a list of volunteer opportunities based on various details including location and cause area, and allows user to register for events.
2. Organizations - provides a list of organizations based on details including location and cause area, and allows user to view more information about the organization.
3. Resources page - page that provides the user with information including pressing ocean issues, the SDG targets, and ways to help.

Creating the low-fidelity prototypes allowed me to first focus on the functionality of the site and test the usability of these features early in development. By doing this, I was able to determine what fundamental changes or improvements to the site I would make before moving into the high-fidelity prorotype where I would focus more on the overall design of the product.
