# Project: Tides of Change

Saige Carter | DH110 | Fall 2022

## 🌊 Introduction

The goal of this project is to help people get involved in ocean conservation by connecting them to volunteer opportunities and organizations. The foundation for the project was based on choosing one of the topics of the UN's sustainable development goals that interested me. I chose the UN Global Goal #14: Life Below Water. 
I chose this topic because, like many, I am very aware of the endangerment of the ocean caused by problems such as plastic pollution, climate change, and overfishing. However, many people can relate in sharing the concern for our ocean, but feel distanced from the problem or disconnected from the ability to help. Therefore, I wanted to focus my project on empowering people to get involved in ocean conservation. 

## 🎗️Design Statement

While looking for websites related to the Life Below Water UN Goal, I found that there was a lack websites/platforms that served as a centralized source for people to get involved. Some would only list individual ways to help such as "reducing waste", "buying local fish", or general statements such as "support a Goal 14 charity" or "organize a cleanup project", but the users were left to find a way to achieve their goals without any resources being provided. After noticing this gap, my question was:  **How might I design an accessible digital platform that empowers users looking to make an impact in ocean conservation efforts by connecting them to volunteer opportunities and organizations that align with their interests?**

## 🤔 Competitor Analysis

### Heurstic Evaluation

The first step was to conduct a heuristic evaluation of the websites [Funding the Ocean](https://fundingtheocean.org/) and [Marine Watch International](https://marinewatchintl.force.com/main/s/?language=en_US) based on the heuristics by [Jakob Neilson](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) to analyze the user interface of its design. If the website was found to violate one of the heuristics, they were given a severity rating. For this task, I looked for websites that attempted to provide the users with resources and connect them to events and organizations related to ocean conservation, so I was interested in seeing how the heuristics related to this kind of website. Below are the overall assesments from the evaluations:

**Funding the Ocean:**
> Funding the Ocean website has an abundance of information, which can be hard to organize but overall the navigation and organization of content was user friendly. However the site has issues in match to the real world, consistency and standards, user control and freedom, recognition rather than recall, and aesthetic and minimalist design. Many of these issues have to do with the Funding Map feature, as it is a unique feature that would require more work into making more intuitive. Visually, I think the website would benefit from greater contrast between the banners and Title text, and the colors of the headers to improve the visual heirarchy.

### Usability Testing

Following my heuristic analysis, I conducted a usability testing on the [Funding the Ocean](https://fundingtheocean.org/) to evaluate the usability of the website and test how the user's ability to reach their goals might be affected by the problems found in the heuristic analysis. I asked the volunteer in the test to complete three tasks that the website offers: 1. Find information about a local organization in Los Angeles 2. Find which resources the website is provides 3. Find events to learn about ocean conservation efforts you can attend virtually. 
I found that during the test, the user was mostly able to complete the tasks they were given, but ran into some difficulty. Unexpectedly, the usability testing also exposed usability problems with the site that I missed during the heuristic analysis.

Below is a full video of the usability testing:

## 🔬 User Research

After identifying the design problems of competitor sites through the heuristic analysis and usability testing, it was important to gain an understanding of the potential users for my site. To achieve this, I conducted a contextual inquiry with someone as close as possible to my target user. I decided to interview someone who was deeply involved with volunteer work to better understand what methods they use to find volunteer opportunities and organizations to get involved with and what kind of information they value in this process. This information was key to keep in mind how I would create a design solution for my target users. Some of the key takeaways included:

1. Information on a social issue itself is not sufficient to help one feel equipped to take action 
2. Those who are interested/experienced in volunteer work care a lot about the "economics" of an organization
3. Time commitment is an important metric used to determine what event one would participate in, so displaying it is helpful 
4. Understanding how it can effect them is important in encouraging people to take action on an issue. 

The full contextual inquiry can be found at [Assignment 3](https://github.com/saigecarter/DH110-22F-SC/tree/main/ASSIGNMENT03).

## 📖 UX Storytelling

### User Personas

After conducting research to better understand my target users, I developed two personas and user journey maps to help me empathize with users and keep in mind _who_ I would be designing the platform for. Based on the previous research conducted, I created personas that would demonstrate the motivations, thoughts, goals, and pain points that a two types of potenital users of my product would have. 

#### User Personas and Empathy Maps 

Persona 1: Alice Smith is a Generation Z college student in Los Angeles, who has been exposed media about the endangerment of the oceans throughout her life and has a deep concern for the issue. She wants to take the next step further than individual actions and get involved with a volunteer organization in her community. 

Persona 2: Kevin Sato is a 26 year olf software engineer based in San Francisco, who was involved in environmentalism throughut his youth, but feels like he has been missing that part of his life in recent years focusing on his career. He is too busy to commit to hands-on volunteer work, but wants to find an organization whose mission he connects with to make donations to.

## 🖊️ Wireframes & Low Fidelity Prototype 

With the developed personas created to guide my design process, I decided to develop three features that the user would have:

1. Volunteer opportunities - provides a list of volunteer opportunities based on various details including location and cause area, and allows user to register for events.
2. Organizations - provides a list of organizations based on details including location and cause area, and allows user to view more information about the organization.
3. Resources page - page that provides the user with information including pressing ocean issues, the SDG targets, and ways to help.

Creating the low-fidelity prototypes allowed me to first focus on the functionality of the site and test the usability of these features early in development. By doing this, I was able to determine what fundamental changes or improvements to the site I would make before moving into the high-fidelity prorotype where I would focus more on the overall design of the product. 

### Initial Lo-Fi Wireflows

**Task 1: Register for a Volunteer Event**

</p>

During the testing process, I was able to see how a user would interact with the site based on the elements that were on the lo-fi prototype. I was able to see where the user might get confused, indicating that I would need to restructure the flow or add something to the page that may have been missing. They mostly able to successfully interact with the prototype, but some highlights from the testing illuminated some aspects that could be improved. This included making certain elements more visible as well as making certain feedback for the user more clear and intuitive.

## 🎨 Interface Design System 

After working on the lofi wireflow and testing the prototype with a volunteer, I created a design system that I would base my high-fidelity prototype on. I tried out multiple variations for the typography, shape, and checked the color constrast for accessibility. Finally, I decided on a layout and the final design system for the hi-fi wireframes. During the process, I learned a lot about how to actually palce the features that I had in mind onto the page and looking at other websites helped me understand how to implement them in an intuitive way. 

Below is an image showing the process of creating the design system:

## 🖼️ High-Fidelity Prototype

Following the user reserach and feedback on the low fidelity prototype and design system, I created a mobile version for the hi fidelity out of the full responsive system. To make the design more mobile-friendly, I also created a profile page as this would usually be found on the navigation bar, and removed the Resources feature as it was slightly too content heavy for a mobile version. This process allowed me to conduct usability test a prototype sp that any improvements could be made before the final product.

## 🔁 Further Evaluations & Revisions

### Impression Test 

After creating the design system, I did an impression test with a volunteer and recieved valuable feedback. She expressed that she would have liked to see at least 6 of the events on one page before having to go the next page. To fix this, I added one more row of the event cards on the page, then changed the layout from 6 rows to 8 rows.

### Cognitive Walkthrough 

After creating the high-fidelity prototypte, a cognitive walkthrough was conducted with two other classmates. First, they gave their initial impressions of app, answered questions about what they thought the app was about and what they thought they could do with the app. Then, they completed tasks in the following order:

1. Find a volunteer opportunity related to ocean conservation near you (in Los Angeles) and register for it.
2. Find an ocean conservation organization and make a donation. 

Overall, they were able to navigate through the app with little difficulty and didn't find any points where the users would feel lost or unsure of progress towards their goal, but they did identify a few issues that could be solved with further improvements. 

| Problem  | Solution |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Because the login/signup page was the first page the users would land on, they were not really sure what the app as about. One was correct in that it was about an enviromental/oceanic problem, but was not sure exactly what they could do with the app. Another thought that the app would be about improving water quality. They also mentioned it was a bit unexpected that the first page they land on after logging in was the Volunteer Opportunities page. | I added more to the onboarding process with two slides that explained what the app does, including the Volunteer Opportunities and Organizations features. In adding this, users would be able to understand what they are able to achieve with the app.  |
| When asked if there was anything inconsistent, missing, or confusing, they said that on the page of a Volunteer Organizations page, it was not obvious to them that they were able to click on the organizations  | To make the name of the organization more obvious that it was clickable, I added an underline to the name, as one classmade had mentioned that is what they would usually expect.  |
| They were confused about what the filter icon was  | To fix the confusion of the filter icon, I changed it from being a filter icon to a button with the word "Filters" to make it more obvious. |
| One classmate mentioned that they expected the donation button to be more visible.  | To fix the visibility of the donation button, I enabled a "fixed" position of the button on the page so that it would remain visible on the page regardless of where the user scrolls on the page  |

### Usability testing 

After implementing the changes to my high-fidelity prototype based on the feedback from the cognitive feedback, I conducted two usability tests on prototype. 

First, I asked them to rate how easy or difficult to use the app looks, how trustworthy the app looks, and how they felt about the overall design of the app. Both participants rated their perception of the app as easy to use, trustworthy, with a pleasant design. 

Next, I asked them to look at the three pages--Volunteer Opportunities, Organizations, and the Profile Page--without navigating anywhere else and explain what they expected to do on the page. Both participants expectations of what they would do on the page aligned with what I had intended with the design. 

Next, I asked them to complete three tasks:

1: Find a volunteer opportunity in your area (Los Angeles) and register for it.

2: Find an organization's page with their information and make a donation.

3: Access your saved/favorited volunteer opportunities and organizations and navigate to their pages.

During this section, the participants were able to fully complete the tasks without any problems. However, there were a few hiccups that I noticed during the testing that could be solved with further improvements to the app:

- The first participant struggled a bit with going to the next page on the onboarding process, but I believe that because they were using a mobile prototype, the were not sure if they were able to drag the screen as you usually would on mobile. In the second usability test, I let the participant know that they could interact with the prototype as they would on a mobile screen, and they did not run into the same problem. However, to make the design more accessible in edge cases, I could still add a button or side arrows to make it easier for the user. 

- At one point, I noticed that the first participant tried to click on the entire card for the Organizations rather than the "Learn More" button at first, so I asked them about it. They said that they felt that they would usually go for the "Learn more" button, but since apps have more recently been making the entire card clickable, that was their initial instinct. To fix this, I could make the entire card clickable rather than only the learn more, or remove the learn more entirely.

| When the second participant was asked to list the "Cause areas" of an organization, they did not list the cause areas with the pill design, but listed information that they found from the mission statement.   | This could be easily solved by making the pills more visible to the user, either by making them larger or choosing a different way to display the information.  |
