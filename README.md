# Project: Tides of Change

Saige Carter | DH110 | Fall 2022

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to help people get involved in ocean conservation by connecting them to volunteer opportunities and organizations. The foundation for the project was based on choosing one of the topics of the UN's sustainable development goals that interested me. I chose the UN Global Goal #14: Life Below Water. 
I chose this topic because, like many, I am very aware of the endangerment of the ocean caused by problems such as plastic pollution, climate change, and overfishing. However, many people can relate in sharing the concern for our ocean, but feel distanced from the problem or disconnected from the ability to help. Therefore, I wanted to focus my project on empowering people to get involved in ocean conservation. 

## Design Statement

While looking for websites related to the Life Below Water UN Goal, I found that there was a lack websites/platforms that served as a centralized source for people to get involved. Some would only list individual ways to help such as "reducing waste", "buying local fish", or general statements such as "support a Goal 14 charity" or "organize a cleanup project", but the users were left to find a way to achieve their goals without any resources being provided. After noticing this gap, my question was: **How might I design an accessible digital platform that empowers users looking to make an impact in ocean conservation efforts by connecting them to volunteer opportunities and organizations that align with their interests? **
