## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

### About the project

The ocean is our most important resource that the world depends on to sustain life, however marine life is suffering due to problems such as chemical pollution, oil spills, plastic waste, and agriculture runoff. The majority of Americans are frustrated with our contribution to ocean pollution, however there is a lack of resources online that would connect people to organizations for ocean conservation. There are plenty of websites providing the user with educational resources such as ocean statistics, and lists of ways that an individual can help, it seems to stop at surface level information. My goal for the project this quarter is to help users find a wesbite that will not only provide them with educatinal resources, but allow them to take a further step into action by connecting them to organizations that align with their goals.

### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group

The following rating scale can be used to evaluate the severity of usability issues:
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |


### Heuristic Evaluation

## Website 1: [Funding the Ocean ]([https://www.mayoclinic.org/](https://fundingtheocean.org/))

#### 1. Visibility of System Status

- I could not find problems on this website for the first heuristic throughout the website. When the mouse hovers over any button or clickable element, it greys out/turns green, guiding the user and demonstrating its response to their actions. After clicking on the options to narrow down a search, the button becomes green and it also shows which topic was selected next to "Showing results for:", successfully providing the user with necessary feedback.

#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World

**Severity Rating: 2** 

- This website has a lot of internal jargon that may be confusing for someone who is not involved in organizations or ocean conservation efforts. For example, not everyone would know what they would find clicking on "Affinity groups" or "Data and report repositories"
- Similarly, in another part of the website, the Foundation Map, certain terms such as "bi/multilateral disembursement/aid" might be confusing for the user. Using more friendly language would be less overwhelming, however if some of the information demands domain-specific language, a short explanation/blurb could be of use.

#### 3. User Control and Freedom

**Severity Rating: 2**

- When clicking on "Contact", the first thing it does is open the default mail app, which may seem easier, but it does not consider edge cases. This is not helpful for all users that might prefer to use a different email or like in my case, do not use their default mail application at all. This caused a problem for me, since I was not logged in I couldn't even get access to their email after pressing the contact button.

- Another possible issue is that in the submit form there is no cancel option, and the user is not able to make changes or edit their submission in case they make an error.

#### 4. Consistency and Standards

**Severity Rating: 1**

- There is a lack of consistency in the feedback the user gets when they hover over a clickable element. In most cases, it will grey out, however on the resources page specifically, it turns green. Additionally, the green color that is used to indicate this is also used for Headers and other elements such as buttons. This can cause confusion for the user, therefore the website should have colors remain different and consistent for CTAs, feedback, and headings, and make sure not to use it in the wrong cases.

#### 5. Error Prevention

**Severity Rating: 1**

- There are a few places in the website where the user can submit forms. In most, the error prevention is satisfactory. If the user forgets to enter a required form, there is a message alerting them. When the user types in an invalid email, before they can finish filling out the form, there is a message that says "Please enter a valid email address", and it does not allow them to submit until these are fixed, preventing them from a mistake. However, it does not do the same for a URL, and would allow the user to submit an invalid URL. 

<img width="470" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114601961/194036754-8bdd67b7-80f0-4849-9820-f3a2ced8c014.png">


#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

**Severity Rating: 2**

- For the Funding Map feature of the website, the website embeds a youtube tutorial on how to use the map. However, the heuristic requries that the user should be able to  navigate through the website based on recognition. By having the user rely on a tutorial, they are being forced to put more effort into learning a website, which may cause their motivation to use the website go down. On a positive note, on the Funding Map page, there are short blurbs when the user hovers over a feature that explain what they are about to click on, which I think increases the sites learnability without forcing them to remember things from a tutorial.

<img width="779" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114601961/194037098-5e3ee111-58fc-41be-93d7-a5fb7166c1cb.png">


#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

- Although the website could be more user-friendly for a regular user, I believe it did a good job in allowing the more advanced users to tailor the content to their level. While the default search on the Funding map is more simple, there is also the option for an advanced search which would allow individuals with specialized knowledge on the topic are able to narrow down what they are looking for.

<img width="1279" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114601961/194039010-dba9ba4e-07a9-4f43-8fca-24c8f353528e.png">


#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

**Severity Rating: 2**

- Throughout most of the website, only the necessary information was available on the screen. However, the Funding Map page was slightly confusing. First, the Funding Map is only found once you click "Explore the Map". However due to the large eye-catching banner and the lack of contrast between the CTA button, the first thing I do every time I click on the page is scroll past it, and it always takes me longer to navigate back to my original goal destination. I think that if the actual button to go to the map were emphasized and not crowded by other elements, it would be easier for the user to navigate to it.

#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors

**Severity Rating: 1**

- Generally, this website did not have issues with this heuristic. As touched on previously, when the user is filling out submission forms on the website and they make a mistake, right away the website will provide them with feedback letting them know that a form is required, or that they have not entered a valid email. Again, however, there is no feedback if the user does not enter a valid URL, and therefore fails to help the user recognize a possible error. 

#### 10. Help and documentation

- I think this site does a good job for this heuristic, specifically in the Funding Map. As this is more of a unique feature, the users might not be familiar with what certain tabs mean. When the user hovers over one of the tabs, there is a small documentation that appears. This is especially helpful because it shows up at the exact moment the user needs it to. 

<img width="269" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114601961/194042077-857b68aa-af69-4d08-8dfd-05f0fd44ea0f.png">


### Overall Assessment

Funding the Ocean website has an abundance of information, which can be hard to organize but overall the navigation and organization of content was user friendly. However the site has issues in match to the real world, consistency and standards, user control and freedom, recognition rather than recall, and aesthetic and minimalist design. Many of these issues have to do with the Funding Map feature, as it is a unique feature that would require more work into making more intuitive. Visually, I think the website would benefit from greater contrast between the banners and Title text, and the colors of the headers to improve the visual heirarchy. 


## Website 2: Marine Watch International (https://marinewatchintl.force.com/main/s/events?language=en_US)

#### 1. Visibility of System Status 

**Severity Rating: 3**

- On the calendar showing events, only the dates with events are highlighted in green, whereas the date for today is just slightly shaded grey, which is hard for the user to see. The green is much more eye catching, which indicated that was the date that I had selected, even though it wasnt. When I hovered over other dates, they also greyed out, but when I tried to click on them, nothing happened. There was no change in what the screen displayed--it just continued to show the dates for the 17th. The only way to select a date other than this was to click on "Today", and after it would display nothing because there are no events. However, it does not indicate this in any way. 

<img width="295" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114601961/194046152-ba1c4c12-4708-4c27-800f-08aa717aac3f.png">

#### 2. Match between System and Real World 

**Severity Rating: 2**

- "Groups" are mentioned in multiple places on the site, however this is not something that an average user is familiar with. As of now, only the creators are aware of what is meant by "Groups". All that is indicated is that it is something that the user can join, but there is no real explanation of their purpose or what they mean in this context. Simply throwing it in as a page may confuse the reader, language that indicates the function would be helpful.

<img width="996" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114601961/194046444-0a64c6e8-5424-49ac-a609-c76d0bda9566.png">
<img width="948" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114601961/194046498-86e42a3f-1e80-46b4-8019-41d4e5484a83.png">

#### 3. User control and freedom

**Severity Rating: 3**

- As mentioned previously, the calendar on the web does not allow the user to click on the dates that are not already highlighted, limiting the user.
- Another issue is that you must be logged in to use the search bar. This feature does not make sense to me, as people are unlikely to sign up for this website without really understanding how to even use the website. This is going to cause many users to give up on the site and leave if they are unable to use one of the main (and only) features on the site immediately. 

<img width="854" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114601961/194047716-95a3632c-69f7-4fb5-934b-29cb7c696f9d.png">

#### 4. Consistency and standards 

**Severity rating: 2**

- Although there is very little on the website, it falls short of this heuristic. There is a lack of consistency on the navigation bar, as when you click on a different page, the elements on the bar actually move around. 
- Another issue is the lack of standards for the text. As shown in the image, it seems like they used random font sizes and weights in order to emphasize certain information, but there is now a lack of visual heirarchy, which can be confusing for the user. I found that my eyes were going all over the place, rather than reading the information top to bottom as I usually would. 

<img width="824" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114601961/194048011-e4b79707-3027-42d0-8764-df86786582c2.png">

#### 5. Error Prevention 

**Severity Rating: 2**

- For the search bar, although it gives a warning saying: "(Must be logged in to use)", this text is found within the search bar where it also says "Search for Organizations & Discussions", making it hard to notice. When I went through it, I didn't notice it and attempted to use the search bar. Even though there is a warning, the site still allows the user to type in and make a search, and it just shows a page with "no results". This can be very confusing if a user does not know that they must be logged in, making it appear as if there is no information at all on the site. 

#### 6. Recognition Rather than Recall 

- Overall, since it is such a simple site with little information currently, and there are no features that are especially unique. The calendar feature for events is intuitive for users since this how most websites display their event information. 

#### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use 

**Severity Rating: 2**

- There are currently no ways for an expert user to increase their efficiency of use on the site all of the actions are the same as an inexperienced user, which may be more tedious for someone using the site regularly. The only difference is that the expert user will likely have an account, granting them access to the search feature. 

#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design 

**Severity Rating: 3**

- On the home page, there should only include their mission/welcome statement and a CTA to register, since most of the site relies on the user being logged in. However, the home page also includes the option to click on the welcome tab, or the groups tag, a feature showing which groups the user is a part of, as well as a complete duplicate of the events page underneath it, even though there are entire pages dedicated to both "events" and "groups". There should only be the necessary information on the homepage, and the information needs to be organized better. There is no need to have two of the same events feature if there is already a page for it, and the feature that shows which groups the user in should be under the groups page.
