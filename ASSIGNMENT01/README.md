## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

### About the project

The ocean is our most important resource that the world depends on to sustain life, however marine life is suffering due to problems such as chemical pollution, oil spills, plastic waste, and agriculture runoff. The majority of Americans are frustrated with our contribution to ocean pollution, however there is a lack of resources online that would connect people to organizations for ocean conservation. There are plenty of websites providing the user with educational resources such as ocean statistics, and lists of ways that an individual can help, it seems to stop at surface level information. My goal for the project this quarter is to help users find a wesbite that will not only provide them with educatinal resources, but allow them to take a further step into action by connecting them to organizations that align with their goals.

| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | Users should always be informed about what is going on and should be given appropriate feedback to their actions |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | Use concepts and language that are familiar and logical to the user |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | Allow users to make mistakes; give them options to undo and redo tasks |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | Follow conventions and make sure design is consistent across the platform |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Get rid of error-prone conditions and provide users with safety nets for high-cost errors |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Minimize user's memory load by giving them suggestions and help in context |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Provide multiple ways to perform a task to make the platform accessible to all users |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Provide only relevant content and features |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | Tell users what the problem is and provide suggestions to fix it |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | Supply users with extra help to complete their tasks |


### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group

The following rating scale can be used to evaluate the severity of usability issues:
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |


### Heuristic Evaluation

## Website 1: [Funding the Ocean ]([https://www.mayoclinic.org/](https://fundingtheocean.org/))

#### 1. Visibility of System Status

- I could not find problems on this website for the first heuristic throughout the website. When the mouse hovers over any button or clickable element, it greys out/turns green, guiding the user and demonstrating its response to their actions. After clicking on the options to narrow down a search, the button becomes green and it also shows which topic was selected next to "Showing results for:", successfully providing the user with necessary feedback.

#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World

**Severity Rating: 2** 

- This website has a lot of internal jargon that may be confusing for someone who is not involved in organizations or ocean conservation efforts. For example, not everyone would know what they would find clicking on "Affinity groups" or "Data and report repositories"
- Similarly, in another part of the website, the Foundation Map, certain terms such as "bi/multilateral disembursement/aid" might be confusing for the user. Using more friendly language would be less overwhelming, however if some of the information demands domain-specific language, a short explanation/blurb could be of use.

#### 3. User Control and Freedom

**Severity Rating: 2**

- When clicking on "Contact", the first thing it does is open the default mail app, which may seem easier, but it does not consider edge cases. This is not helpful for all users that might prefer to use a different email or like in my case, do not use their default mail application at all. This caused a problem for me, since I was not logged in I couldn't even get access to their email after pressing the contact button.

- Another possible issue is that in the submit form there is no cancel option, and the user is not able to make changes or edit their submission in case they make an error.

#### 4. Consistency and Standards

**Severity Rating: 1**

- There is a lack of consistency in the feedback the user gets when they hover over a clickable element. In most cases, it will grey out, however on the resources page specifically, it turns green. Additionally, the green color that is used to indicate this is also used for Headers and other elements such as buttons. This can cause confusion for the user, therefore the website should have colors remain different and consistent for CTAs, feedback, and headings, and make sure not to use it in the wrong cases.

#### 5. Error Prevention

**Severity Rating: 1**

- There are a few places in the website where the user can submit forms. In most, the error prevention is satisfactory. If the user forgets to enter a required form, there is a message alerting them. When the user types in an invalid email, before they can finish filling out the form, there is a message that says "Please enter a valid email address", and it does not allow them to submit until these are fixed, preventing them from a mistake. However, it does not do the same for a URL, and would allow the user to submit an invalid URL.

#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

**Severity Rating: 2**

- For the Funding Map feature of the website, the website embeds a youtube tutorial on how to use the map. However, the heuristic requries that the user should be able to  navigate through the website based on recognition. By having the user rely on a tutorial, they are being forced to put more effort into learning a website, which may cause their motivation to use the website go down. On a positive note, on the Funding Map page, there are short blurbs when the user hovers over a feature that explain what they are about to click on, which I think increases the sites learnability without forcing them to remember things from a tutorial.

#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

- Although the website could be more user-friendly for a regular user, I believe it did a good job in allowing the more advanced users to tailor the content to their level. While the default search on the Funding map is more simple, there is also the option for an advanced search which would allow individuals with specialized knowledge on the topic are able to narrow down what they are looking for.

<img width="1279" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114601961/194039010-dba9ba4e-07a9-4f43-8fca-24c8f353528e.png">


#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

**Severity Rating: 2"

- Throughout most of the website, only the necessary information was available on the screen. However, the Funding Map page was slightly confusing. First, the Funding Map is only found once you click "Explore the Map". However due to the large eye-catching banner and the lack of contrast between the CTA button, the first thing I do every time I click on the page is scroll past it, and it always takes me longer to navigate back to my original goal destination. I think that if the actual button to go to the map were emphasized and not crowded by other elements, it would be easier for the user to navigate to it.

#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors

- Generally, this website did not have issues with this heuristic. As touched on previously, when the user is filling out submission forms on the website and they make a mistake, right away the website will provide them with feedback letting them know that a form is required, or that they have not entered a valid email. Again, however, there is no feedback if the user does not enter a valid URL, and therefore fails to help the user recognize a possible error.
