# ASSIGNMENT #07: Hifi Prototype
*Saige Carter | DH 110: User Experience Design*

## Project Description
My project aims to provide an accesible digital experience that empowers users who are looking to make an impact in ocean conservation efforts by connecting them to volunteer opportunities and organizations that align with their interests.

### Purpose of Interactive Prototype
The purpose of this interactive prototype is to demonstrate as close as possible how the actual product might function. This allows designers to conduct usability testing with the target users (and other stakeholders) so that any improvements can be made before the final product.

### Process
The high fidelity prototype was created using Figma, on a iPhone 13 / 13 Pro screen. I created the prototype by building off of what I had in the low fidelity wireframes and applying the design system. However, I converted the desktop layout of the lofi wireframes and the design system to create a responsive design with a mobile version instead. To make the design more mobile-friendly, I also created a profile page and removed the Resources feature.

## Tasks
1. Login/Create account
2. Look for and register for a volunteer opportunity 
3. Look for a nonprofit organization
4. Access saved events and organizations
