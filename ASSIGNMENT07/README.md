# ASSIGNMENT #07: Hifi Prototype
*Saige Carter | DH 110: User Experience Design*

## Project Description
My project aims to provide an accesible digital experience that empowers users who are looking to make an impact in ocean conservation efforts by connecting them to volunteer opportunities and organizations that align with their interests.

### Purpose of Interactive Prototype
The purpose of this interactive prototype is to demonstrate as close as possible how the actual product might function. This allows designers to conduct usability testing with the target users (and other stakeholders) so that any improvements can be made before the final product.

### Process
The high fidelity prototype was created using Figma, on a iPhone 13 / 13 Pro screen. I created the prototype by building off of what I had in the low fidelity wireframes and applying the design system. However, I converted the desktop layout of the lofi wireframes and the design system to create a responsive design with a mobile version instead. To make the design more mobile-friendly, I also created a profile page as this would usually be found on the navigation bar, and removed the Resources feature as it was slightly too content heavy for a mobile version.

## Tasks
1. Login/Create account
2. Look for and register for a volunteer opportunity 
3. Find a nonprofit organization and make a donation
4. Access saved events and organizations

## Cognitive Walkthrough

A cognitive walkthrough was conducted with two other classmates during Week 9 and took roughly 15 minutes. During the walkthrough, two classmates went through the prototype of the app and gave their impressions of it as well as answered questions about the app while completing tasks. They first answered questions about what they saw and what they expected the app was about/what it did. They then complete the tasks in the following order: 1) Find a volunteer opportunity near you (Los Angeles) and register for it. 2) Find a volunteer organization and make a donation.

> Overall, they didn't find any points where users would feel lost or unsure of progress towards their goal, not know what to do for the next step, or its unclear where to return/the back-flow of cancel or exit is missing.

> They found that since the login/singup page was the first page the users would land on, they were not really sure what the app as about. One was correct in that it was about an enviromental/oceanic problem, but was not sure exactly what they could do with the app. Another thought that the app would be about improving water quality. 
> 
> They also mentioned it was a bit unexpected that the first page they land on after logging in was the Volunteer Opportunities page. 

**Solution:**

In the second iteration, I added more to the onboarding process with two slides that explained what the app does, including the Volunteer Opportunities and Organizations features. In adding this, users would be able to understand what they are able to achieve with the app. 

I believe this also aids in the Volunteer Opportunities page as the first page they land on being unexpected, since the onboarding gives them a sense of what to expect. 


> When asked if there was anything inconsistent, missing, or confusing, they said that on the page of a Volunteer Organizations page, it was not obvious to them that they were able to click on the organizations name and that they were confused about the filter icon. 
> 
> One classmate mentioned that they expected the donation button to be more visible.

**Solution:**

To make the name of the organization more obvious that it was clickable, I added an underline to the name, as one classmade had mentioned that is what they would usually expect. 

To fix the confusion of the filter icon, I changed it from being a filter icon to a button with the word "Filters" to make it more obvious. 

## Second Iteration of the Interactive Prototype

## Usability Testing 

To test the usability of the app, I asked a volunteer general questions about the app and asked her to complete the following tasks:
1: Find a volunteer opportunity in your area (Los Angeles) and register for it.
2: Find an organization's page with their information and make a donation.
3: Access your saved/favorited volunteer opportunities and organizations and navigate to their pages. 

Please find the video of the usability testing [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k7RQPePnFlIQRFIDB8CAaxGe6wnmAHzh/view?usp=sharing)

Please find the survey for usability testing [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFq7DWYhmQHCb0UKvjV2_YMTRY096zx4Al9-7u3qJPbNviDw/viewform?usp=sharing) 
*This is the responder link, but professor has been added as a collaborator to view responses**

In the beginning of the survey, the volunteer found that the website looked easy to use, trustworthy, with a pleasant design. 
When asked what they expected to do on each page, their answers were all correct. 

For Volunteer Opportunities page:
> "I would expect to click on each of these events and learn more about them in order to sign up for volunteer opportunities."

For Organizations page:
> "I would expect to be able to browse organizations and learn more about them including their goals and objectives. I feel like I would go here to gauge more information if I was interested in joining one of these orgs."

Here, the only thing they were not expecting was the ability to donate. 

For profile page:
> "I would expect to be able to access any saved events/volunteer opportunities and organizations that I was interested in and wanted to revist."

The participant was able to fully complete the tasks without any problems and remarked that everything was very intutitive to them.

The participant struggled a bit with going to the next page on the onboarding process, but I believe that because they were using a mobile prototype, the were not sure if they were able to drag the screen as you usually would on mobile. 
To fix this I could still add a button or side arrows to make it easier for the user in edge cases. 

At one point, I noticed that rather than clicking "Learn more" on the card for the Organizations, they tried to click on the entire card at first, so I asked them about it and their response was:

> "I feel like normally I would go for "Learn more", but I feel like recently, I just notived that they make the whole thing accessible. So like, I kind of got used to it like that. But that's like a recent thing that I've noticed with apps, but it didn't really bother me."

I could fix this by making the entire card clickable rather than only the learn more, or remove the learn more entirely. However, since the participant mentioned this was something in recent apps, I wonder how intuitive it would be without the button. 

Overall, I felt that the usability testing went well and I learned about a few things that could help my app improve. For the next usability testing, I would like to interview a participant that was even closer to the target user demographic.
